# The Long Way Home

A story-driven science-fiction automation adventure. This fresh Godot project
has a player movement prototype with camera follow and mouse-wheel zoom. A minimal
environment and collision foundation is implemented on
`codex/environment-foundation`, pending merge. It is independent of the
previous FactoryGame project.

## Requirements and setup

Codex must follow the [Godot execution safety policy](AGENTS.md#godot-execution-safety)
before using the setup or launch instructions below. Graphical execution requires
explicit owner authorization; all headless execution is suspended following the
PR #5 incident until the owner explicitly lifts that restriction.

- Godot **4.7.2 stable**, standard build. GDScript is the initial scripting language;
  no .NET SDK or third-party plugins are required.
- Git for cloning the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/interneth3ro/the-long-way-home.git
cd the-long-way-home
godot --editor --path .
```

`godot` denotes your Godot executable; use its full path if it is not on `PATH`.
Alternatively, import `project.godot` through Godot's Project Manager.

## Launch and validation

Press **F6** with `scenes/main/main.tscn` open, or **F5** to run the project.
From a terminal in the project root:

```sh
godot --path .
godot --headless --editor --path . --quit
godot --headless --path . --quit-after 60
```

The last two commands validate editor import and a bounded main-scene launch.
Headless checks do not verify graphical appearance. While execution is restricted,
use only nonexecuting checks under the policy above and report them as static
validation; runtime and engine verification remain unperformed.

## Layout and development

- `project.godot`: engine settings and main-scene entry point.
- `scenes/main/main.tscn`: primitive test floor, four static perimeter walls, and a
  Y-sorted group containing three static obstacles and an instance of Dave.
- `scenes/player/dave.tscn`: reusable `CharacterBody2D`, a collision shape, a
  `Camera2D` child, and a separate `Visual` child containing placeholder polygons.
- `scenes/player/dave.gd`: movement through `_physics_process()` and
  `move_and_slide()`.
- `scenes/player/follow_camera.gd`: wheel input and bounded zoom transitions using
  a built-in Tween; following uses the child camera's built-in behavior.
- `docs/GAME_VISION.md`: approved direction and unresolved design questions.
- `AGENTS.md`: development conventions.

Use **WASD** or the **arrow keys** to move. The Input Map actions are `move_left`,
`move_right`, `move_up`, and `move_down`; WASD uses physical key positions.
`Input.get_vector()` limits direction length to one, keeping diagonal keyboard
movement at the same 240 pixels per second as cardinal movement. Dave's local
origin is his ground-contact position; replace the contents of `Visual` with
future artwork aligned to that origin without changing the controller or camera.

The camera follows Dave's ground-contact origin independently of `Visual`.
**Mouse wheel up** zooms in; **mouse wheel down** zooms out, centered on Dave.
Zoom starts at 1.0, changes its target by 0.1 per wheel press, and is clamped to
0.75–1.5. These are provisional tuning values in `follow_camera.gd`. Each changed
target starts a 0.15-second eased Tween from the current zoom; rapid scrolling
retargets the transition, and repeated input at a bound leaves it running to
completion. No per-frame zoom callback runs when a transition is idle.

The test floor spans x = -2048 to 2048 and y = -1536 to 1536 (4096 × 3072).
Dave spawns at (0, 0), clear of all collision footprints. Four 32-pixel-thick
`StaticBody2D` walls sit just outside the floor; their rectangular shapes meet at
the corners. Three obstacles sit at (-320, -180), (360, 40), and (0, 420), with
160 × 48, 96 × 64, and 160 × 48 collision footprints respectively. All bodies use
the default collision layer/mask, matching Dave. Shapes and colored polygon
visuals are separate children; no additional scripts or assets are needed.

`GroundObjects` enables built-in Y-sorting for Dave and the obstacle roots at the
same default Z index. Each obstacle root is anchored at the bottom center of its
ground footprint, matching Dave's ground-contact origin. Its collision rectangle
extends upward from that anchor, while its taller visual extends above the
footprint to allow overlap when Dave stands behind it. Visual children stay
together as one sorted object. The floor and perimeter are outside this group.
There are no camera limits; floor edges can still become visible near the walls.
Existing movement, camera/zoom, display, rendering, and physics settings are
preserved.

Validation for this feature is static only: scene/resource references, rectangle
placement, spawn clearance, Y-sorting hierarchy, unchanged scripts/settings,
documentation links, and Git diff checks. Godot has not been executed; engine
loading, collision response, and graphical layering remain unverified. Before
merging, the owner should manually check all four walls and corners, walk around
each obstacle from every direction, slide along its edges, and confirm Dave
appears behind its upper visual and in front below its anchor. Also verify camera
follow and mouse-wheel zoom throughout the area, including both zoom bounds.

Add feature directories and GDScript files when they have a concrete purpose.
Keep Godot's `.godot/` cache untracked. Use feature branches and pull requests;
validate affected scenes and scripts before requesting review.

Keep authoritative documentation in `docs/` and generated evidence out of Git;
the artifact retention and ZIP policies are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
Use [documentation-sync](.agents/skills/documentation-sync/SKILL.md) before PR
review. After an approved merge, separately request
[post-merge-cleanup](.agents/skills/post-merge-cleanup/SKILL.md) for that PR number
from a chat attached to a surviving checkout. Cleanup stops when preservation,
attachment or Windows lock safety cannot be verified.
